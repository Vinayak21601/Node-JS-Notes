# 🖥️ CLI vs 🖼️ GUI

## What are they?

- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A text-based interface where users type commands to interact with the system.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: A visual interface using windows, icons, and buttons to perform actions.

---

## ✅ CLI (Command Line Interface)

**Examples**: Terminal, Command Prompt, Bash, PowerShell

### Advantages
- Faster for experienced users
- Low resource consumption
- Great for automation and scripting
- Offers more flexibility and control

### Disadvantages
- Steep learning curve
- No visual feedback; commands must be memorized
- Easy to make mistakes

---

## ✅ GUI (Graphical User Interface)

**Examples**: Windows, macOS, GNOME, KDE

### Advantages
- User-friendly and intuitive
- Easier for beginners
- Visual feedback helps reduce errors
- Drag and drop support

### Disadvantages
- Slower for repetitive tasks
- Uses more system resources
- Limited automation features

# 🌐 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **runtime environment** that allows you to run **JavaScript on the server-side**. Built on **Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine**, Node.js enables developers to create scalable and high-performance applications using JavaScript outside of the browser.

> ⚡️ In simple terms, Node.js lets you use JavaScript to write backend/server-side logic.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Asynchronous & Non-blocking I/O**  
  Efficiently handles multiple requests simultaneously without waiting.

- **Single-threaded Event Loop**  
  Uses a single-threaded architecture to handle concurrent operations via events and callbacks.

- **Cross-platform**  
  Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- **Package Manager (npm)**  
  Comes with **npm**, the largest open-source library ecosystem in the world.

- **Fast Execution**  
  Uses the V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript into machine code.
